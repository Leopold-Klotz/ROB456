These are all fancy versions of a coin toss (returns T/F with 50% probability each), a roll of the dice (returns 1..6 with equal probability).\n","\n","ALL of these \"simulate probability\" routines can be implemented using JUST numpy's uniform number generator  (generates a number between 0 and 1 with all values equally likely). The simplest way to think of all of these methods is that you chop up the unit interval 0..1 into the number of possible outcomes, with each bit of the unit interval representing how likely that event is. Then you just generate a number from 0 to 1 and see which bin you fell into.\n","\n","For continuous probability functions, you use uniform twice - once to pick the x value, once to pick the y value. We will not do this here.\n","\n","Why the functions are set up they way they are: You need to input how likely each discrete event is. There's three basic methods for specifying this.\n","1) List each discrete event and how likely it is\n","2) All events are equally likely, just say how many there are (bins) and the mapping between the bins and the 'labels'.Usually the bins represent some spatial variable like location or angle, but could be movement\n","3) There is a function that represents how likely each event is, with the x coordinate representing some continuous variable like distance (think Gaussian error for movement)\n","\n","For each method that you'll implement the above information is passed in using a dictionary.
